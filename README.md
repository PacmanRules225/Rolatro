# Rolatro (A Roblox X Balatro Mod)
This mod adds various aspects of the popular online game Roblox to Balatro, ranging from the modern, to the nostalgic, to the... controversial. Aside from new Jokers, seals, and more, this mod also adds two new consumables called Gears and Experiences.
It is RECOMMENDED to turn on Pixel Art Smoothing as a majority of the Rolatro textures are 142 by 190 pixels. Don't say I didn't warn you if you have it off.
